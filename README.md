## Architecture

This application follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with a **Test-Driven Development** approach:

- **Models**: Pure data structures (User, Chapter, University, BlogPost)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views that bind to ViewModels
- **ViewModels**: Business logic, form validation, data transformation
- **Services**: Data management and persistence
- **Protocols**: Service abstractions for dependency injection and testing

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support
- iOS 13+ (SwiftUI requirement)
- macOS (via Mac Catalyst)
- iPhone 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

### Technologies
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for data binding
- **MVVM**: Architecture pattern
- **XCTest**: Unit testing framework
- **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Dependency injection
- **UserDefaults**: Local data persistence

4. **Command line testing**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -scheme SwiftChapterUSA_finder -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
   ```

### For iOS Deployment

To support iOS 11-16:
- Set Deployment Target to iOS 13.0 (minimum for SwiftUI)
- Note: iOS 11-12 require UIKit; this SwiftUI version supports iOS 13+

### For macOS Support

1. Add macOS target via Mac Catalyst:
   - Select project in navigator
   - Select target
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Check "Mac" under Supported Destinations

## Data Storage

Currently uses UserDefaults for local storage. For production use, consider:
- Firebase for real-time database
- CloudKit for iCloud sync
- Core Data for local persistence
- RESTful API backend

## Future Enhancements

- Push notifications for chapter events
- Map integration for chapter locations
- Event calendar
- Photo sharing
- Direct messaging between members
- Chapter leadership tools
- Integration with official TPUSA systems (with permission)

## Important Notes

1. **Not Official**: This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Turning Point USA
2. **Data**: Chapter and university data is sample/placeholder data
3. **Authentication**: Uses basic local authentication; implement proper backend for production
4. **Privacy**: No real user data is transmitted; implement privacy policy for production
